Title: mlxR: Simulation of longitudinal data
Description: mlxR can be used for the simulation and visualization of complex
    models for longitudinal data. The models are encoded using the model coding
    language Mlxtran, automatically converted into C++ codes, compiled on the
    fly and linked to R using the Rcpp package. That allows one to implement
    very easily complex ODE based models and complex statistical models,
    including mixed effects models, for continuous, count, categorical, and
    time-to-event data.
